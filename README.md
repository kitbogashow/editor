# Hello there! 
We're looking TO PAY REAL MONEY $USD for a freelance editor who can bring creative vision + ideas to the kitbogashow team. 

If you are interested we are looking for someone to review this call:
https://drive.protonmail.com/urls/B3G062MZN4#CWYobxWiv0vC
After reviewing the "rough" footage what kind of direction would you have for it:
- what would the focus of the edit be, or would you ignore it for the main channel... why?
- how would you end the video / wrap up the story?
- what things might you "insert" into the edit (post production)
- what might you title it

email stuff here:
hello@kitbogashow.com 

If you can send examples of past work, or if you can edit the above call that'd be super. 
Hoping to get a feel of how you "pace" videos, what you would cut out, and how you would "frame" this to be a unique video for the channel. 

*I am not looking to monetize your edits and nothing you send me will be used without negotiating some sort of a deal first*
